I often use this way to redirect it directly from Java Bean: 
FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getExternalContext().redirect(Url);




The proper way of redirecting pages on JSF specially in JSF 2 is returning
 the name of the view from the method call:

For example:

public String doLogin() {
    //apply the login logic.
    return "name/of/the/view?facesRedirect=true"
}



Your filter is redirecting HTTP requests to JSF resources as well. You need to change your filter logic to add a check if the current request isn't a JSF resource request. You can do that by checking if the request URI does not start with ResourceHandler.RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER after the context path.

if (request.getRequestURI().startsWith(request.getContextPath() + ResourceHandler.RESOURCE_IDENTIFIER)) {
    chain.doFilter(request, response);
}
else {
    response.sendRedirect(request.getContextPath() + "/login.xhtml");
}
