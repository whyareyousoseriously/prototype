f your h:commandLink is inside a h:dataTable there is another reason why the h:commandLink might not work:

The underlying data-source which is bound to the h:dataTable must also be available in the second JSF-Lifecycle that is triggered when the link is clicked.

So if the underlying data-source is request scoped, the h:commandLink does not work!
